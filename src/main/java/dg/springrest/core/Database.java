 * This class will serve as the mediator between this RESTful API and the H2 Database.
 * This class ensures that calls directly to the H2 Database are made in the same spot to keep debugging simple.
 *
 * It's possible that this class will not be used, as I am not entirely confident that it is necessary. Putting it
 * here for the initial commit anyways.
